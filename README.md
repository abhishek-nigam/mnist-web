# mnist-web

Mnist-web is a project that uses the MNSIT dataset to train a machine learning model to classificate hand-drawn digits.

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
The project interface uses HTML canva for a easy and simple  user interaction
